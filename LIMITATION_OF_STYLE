Suggest that this is a limitation of style when compared to applicative styles

    public List sort(List numArray) {
   	 int pivot = 0;

   	 List result = sort (numArray.filter(x -> numArray.get(x) < numArray.get(pivot)));
   			 result.add(numArray.get(0));
   			 result.addAll(sort (numArray.filter(x -> numArray.get(x) > numArray.get(pivot))));
   	 return result;

result needs to be computed by side effects before the filter is finally applied to numArray
