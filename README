Java 8 is to ship with lambda expressions and a completely retooled set of Collections libraries.

A distinguishing feature of Java 1 through to 7 is the absence of a clean lambda abstraction technique:
the nearest approximation to this construct would be anonymous inner classes.

This is to explore the question of how lambda expressions will fit into the
Java 8 datatyping strategy including generics and collections.

A surrounding question is what function-passing styles might be permitted as a result of the new abstraction:
this has some bearing on how to practically implement effective Curries.

The objective of my repo is to kick of some early explorations of these topics.

See file src/QuickSortSerial.java for a simple test.
